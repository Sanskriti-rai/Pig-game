<h1>Pig-Game</h1>
<p>Pig is a simple dice game.

  Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
    <ul>
    <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
    <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    </ul>

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
